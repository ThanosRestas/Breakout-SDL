This is a Breakout clone that will feature a more advanced collision detection system, a tiling system and a debug mode. 

Debug mode will future information such as position offsets and velocities for every moving object on the screen plus frame rates for the screen itself.Its main purpose will be , apart from debuging itself, to ensure the creation of a "tight enough" and responsive gameplay via the observation of several values that will affect the flow of the game at any given time. Instruction : press F1 to enable debug mode and press 1(number key) to up the ball velocities or 2 to lower them.

Windows users will have to wait for binaries in the future.

Linux users should first install the required dependencies by executing the following command :

apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

Have fun.
