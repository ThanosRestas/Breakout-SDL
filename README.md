This is a Breakout clone that will feature a more advanced collision detection system, a tiling system and a debug mode. 

Debug mode will future information such as position offsets and velocities for every moving object on the screen plus frame rates for the screen itself.

Windows users will have to wait for binaries in the future.

Linux users should first install the required dependencies by executing the following command :

apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

Have fun.
